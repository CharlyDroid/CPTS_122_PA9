|Program Description| Code We Wrote |
| ------------------| ---------- |
|  The *Flight Data Playback Simulator 5000<sup>©</sup>* is a brand new, high powered rocketry simulation **built by engineers, for engineers!** | The C++ code we wrote can be found in: Source/CPTS_122_PA9. Additional code we wrote can be found in the Unreal project blueprints (this requires opening the Unreal editor). Everything else in the repository is either a Visual Studio project file or an Unreal Engine dependency.|
<br>

|Program Setup | 
| ------------------| 
| Since we chose to use Unreal Engine for this project, looking at the project files and the whole project is an involved process. That being said, there are two options: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Download Zip [here](https://emailwsu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/charles_ludwig_wsu_edu/EWtZpxr7m5VBu8qj2ujPDQQBiJ8AqJeCOStjC7akV-5XZg?e=iRdTbX) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Extract files and run game. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Run executable file "CPTS_122_PA9.exe" <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Open full project <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Install Unreal Engine Version 5.4.4.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Ensure Visual Studio C++ Integration tool is working.
